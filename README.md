# Real-Time-Detection-of-circuit-components-using-YOLOv4-model
In this project, I explore the application of YOLOv4, a prominent deep learning methodology, for real-time detection and classification of electrical circuit components. Traditionally, circuit components, positioned variably in scanned images prevalent in electrical and electronics engineering, were treated individually using conventional methods. However, to enhance efficiency, I leveraged the You Only Look Once (YOLOv4) approach for object detection. YOLOv4, designed for rapid object detection and classification, minimizes the need for extensive image data preprocessing and automates the feature extraction phase. My objective was to achieve precise detection and classification of three distinct circuit components—resistor, inductor, and capacitor—within circuit images. I implemented the model using the MATLAB programming language. To train the model, I curated a dataset comprising 400 circuit component images. I applied fine-tuning and adjustments to a pre-trained YOLOv4 model according the suggestion that I found in the MatLab doc https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/pretrained-yolo-v4, to custom train the net to fulfill my needs. The training process spanned 90 epochs, and I evaluated the model’s efficacy on diverse circuit component positions. The trained YOLOv4 model exhibited swift and high-performance detection of circuit components in real-time scenarios. This project showcases efficiency and effectiveness for real-time detection applications in electrical circuit analysis.
